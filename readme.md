# [Sip]() lets you efficiently manage your favorite cocktail recipes.
It also lets you:
- Save the cocktail recipe you told your friend you would try sometime. This time, you insist to them, you wont forget.
- Pull up that cocktail recipe when you're finally in the mood for something experimental.
- Edit that recipe when you remember that your friend isn't that great at making cocktails. You don't think it makes any sense to use peanut butter with gin. You're probably right.
- Delete that recipe it when you decide that you're better off building one from scratch.
